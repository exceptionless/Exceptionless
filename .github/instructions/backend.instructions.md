# Backend Guidelines (ASP.NET Core / C#)

## Framework & Best Practices

- Code can be formatted with `dotnet format` and checked for errors with `dotnet build`.

## Conventions & Best Practices

- Adhere to the `.editorconfig` file and Microsoft's [coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

## Architectural Considerations

- Design services with awareness of distributed computing challenges.
