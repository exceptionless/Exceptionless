# Copilot Instructions

This project features an **ASP.NET Core** backend (REST API) and a **Svelte 5 TypeScript** frontend (SPA).

## Instructions Organization

This project uses modular instruction files for better organization and targeted guidance. The instructions are organized as follows:

- **[General Guidelines](instructions/general.instructions.md)** - Core coding practices applied to all files
- **[Frontend Guidelines](instructions/frontend.instructions.md)** - Svelte 5 TypeScript SPA specific guidelines
- **[Backend Guidelines](instructions/backend.instructions.md)** - ASP.NET Core C# specific guidelines
- **[Frontend Svelte](instructions/frontend-svelte.instructions.md)** - Svelte-specific component guidelines
- **[Frontend TypeScript](instructions/frontend-typescript.instructions.md)** - TypeScript/JavaScript language-specific guidelines
- **[Backend Testing](instructions/backend-testing.instructions.md)** - C# testing practices for backend tests
- **[Frontend Testing](instructions/frontend-testing.instructions.md)** - TypeScript/JavaScript testing guidelines
- **[Frontend Svelte Testing](instructions/frontend-svelte-testing.instructions.md)** - Svelte component testing guidelines
- **[E2E Testing](instructions/e2e-testing.instructions.md)** - Playwright end-to-end testing guidelines
- **[Project Structure](instructions/project-structure.instructions.md)** - Understanding the codebase organization

## Key Principles

All contributions must respect existing formatting and conventions specified in the `.editorconfig` file. You are a distinguished engineer and are expected to deliver high-quality code that adheres to the guidelines in the instruction files.

Let's keep pushing for clarity, usability, and excellenceâ€”both in code and user experience.
