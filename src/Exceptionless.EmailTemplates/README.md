# Foundation for Emails Template

[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-emails-template/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-emails-template#info=devDependencies)

**Please open all issues with this template on the main [Foundation for Emails](http://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/issues) repo.**

This is the official starter project for [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails), a framework for creating responsive HTML devices that work in any email client. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with [Panini](http://github.com/zurb/panini)
- Simplified HTML email syntax with [Inky](http://github.com/zurb/inky)
- Sass compilation
- Image compression
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- Full email inlining process

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 0.12 or greater. The template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Emails project:

```bash
foundation new --framework emails
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

## Build Commands

Run `npm start` to kick off the build process. A new browser tab will open with a server pointing to your project files.

Run `npm run build` to inline your CSS into your HTML along with the rest of the build process.

Run `npm run litmus` to build as above, then submit to litmus for testing. *AWS S3 Account details required (config.json)*

Run `npm run mail` to build as above, then send to specified email address for testing. *SMTP server details required (config.json)*

Run `npm run zip` to build as above, then zip HTML and images for easy deployment to email marketing services. 

## Litmus Tests (config.json)

Testing in Litmus requires the images to be hosted publicly. The provided gulp task handles this by automating hosting to an AWS S3 account. Provide your Litmus and AWS S3 account details in the `example.config.json` and then rename to `config.json`. Litmus config, and `aws.url` are required, however if you follow the [aws-sdk suggestions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html) you don't need to supply the AWS credentials into this JSON.

```json
{
  "aws": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY",
    "secretAccessKey": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SECRET",
    "params": {
        "Bucket": "elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-THIS_IS_JUST_AN_EXAMPLE"
    },
    "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-THIS_IS_JUST_AN_EXAMPLE"
  },
  "litmus": {
    "username": "YOUR_LITMUS@EMAIL.com",
    "password": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD",
    "url": "https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.litmus.com",
    "applications": ["ol2003","ol2007","ol2010","ol2011","ol2013","chromegmailnew","chromeyahoo","appmail9","iphone5s","ipad","android4","androidgmailapp"]
  }
}
```

## Manual email tests (config.json)

Similar to the Litmus tests, you can have the emails sent to a specified email address. Just like with the Litmus tests, you will need to provide AWS S3 account details in `config.json`. You will also need to specify to details of an SMTP server. The email address to send to emails to can either by configured in the `package.json` file or added as a parameter like so: `npm run mail -- --to="example.com"`

```json
{
  "aws": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY",
    "secretAccessKey": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SECRET",
    "params": {
        "Bucket": "elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-THIS_IS_JUST_AN_EXAMPLE"
    },
    "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-THIS_IS_JUST_AN_EXAMPLE"
  },
  "mail": {
    "to": [
      "example@domain.com"
    ],
    "from": "Company name <info@company.com",
    "smtp": {
      "auth": {
        "user": "example@domain.com",
        "pass": "12345678"
      },
      "host": "smtp.domain.com",
      "secureConnection": true,
      "port": 465
    }
  }
}
```
