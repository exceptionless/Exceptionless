The definition of the word exceptionless is: to be without exception. [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com) provides real-time error reporting for your JavaScript, Node, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, and MVC apps. It organizes the gathered information into simple actionable data that will help your app become exceptionless!

⭐️ We appreciate your star, it helps!

## Using Exceptionless

Refer to the [Exceptionless documentation](https://exceptionless.com/docs/).

## Hosting Options

We provide very reasonably priced hosting at [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com). By using our hosted service, you are supporting the project and helping it get better! We also provide set up and support services.

Exceptionless can easily be run locally using Docker:
- `docker run --rm -it -p 5200:8080 exceptionless/exceptionless:latest`
- Open `http://localhost:5200`
- Create an account. The first account in the system will automatically be an admin.

This will run a completely self-contained simple instance of Exceptionless. It is only suitable for testing purposes since it will not persist data. For more complete setups, check out the [self hosting documentation](https://exceptionless.com/docs/self-hosting/). Also, if you want to support the project while self hosting you can send us a pull request or [donation](https://github.com/sponsors/exceptionless).

## Contributing

_In appreciation for anyone who submits a non-trivial pull request, we will give you a free [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com) paid plan for a year. After your pull request is accepted, simply send an email to team@exceptionless.io with the name of your organization and we will upgrade you to a paid plan._

## UI Only Development

The UI is a SPA application that runs against the Exceptionless API. The source is located in the `src/Exceptionless.Web/ClientApp` folder. The UI will automatically be started when running the whole project, but if you want to work on just the UI, then open Visual Studio Code to the `src/Exceptionless.Web/ClientApp` folder and run the `npm run serve (use exceptionless api)` task to start the UI pointing at the official Exceptionless API. You will need to login to your actual Exceptionless account.

## API Only Development

You can work on just the API without running the SPA UI by selecting the `Exceptionless API` launch configuration in Visual Studio. You can then run requests using the `exceptionless.http` file. Make sure that you have the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension installed.
